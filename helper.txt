for Functions
// "pure" or "view" 
// "view" modifier indicates that the function will not alter the storage of state in any way
// "pure" modifier (even more strict) indicates that it wont even read the storage state 
// "external" - can be called from outside (basically "public")  (Cheaper gas!)
// "view" - because it doesn't modify state...it just returns a value

// private - can be accessible only within in the smart contract
// internal - can be accessible within smart contract and also derived smart contract
